## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
- Android device with BLE support (API 26+)
- Vitruvian Trainer machine for testing

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in Android Studio Arctic Fox or newer
3. Sync Gradle files (will auto-download dependencies)
4. Build the project: `./gradlew build`
5. Run on a physical device (BLE doesn't work on emulators)

**Build Configuration:**
- Compile SDK: 36
- Min SDK: 26 (Android 8.0)
- Target SDK: 36
- Kotlin: Latest stable
- Gradle: 8.x

### Building Signed Release APK

The app now includes automatic APK signing for release builds to prevent "App not installed as package appears to be invalid" errors:

```bash
# Build signed release APK
./gradlew assembleRelease

# Output location
app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

**Note:** The release builds use Android's debug keystore for signing. For production releases, configure a proper release keystore in `app/build.gradle.kts`.

### Permissions Required

- `BLUETOOTH_SCAN` - For scanning BLE devices (Android 12+)
- `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT` - For connecting to BLE devices (Android 12+)
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` - Required for BLE scanning on older Android versions
- `BLUETOOTH` / `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` - For older Android versions

## Usage

1. Launch the app
2. Tap "Scan for Device" to find your Vitruvian machine (devices starting with "Vee")
3. Connect to your device
4. Configure workout parameters (mode, weight, reps)
5. Tap "Start Workout" to begin
6. Monitor real-time metrics during workout
7. Tap "Stop Workout" when complete

## BLE Protocol

The app implements the full Vitruvian BLE protocol:

- **Init Command:** 4-byte initialization
- **Init Preset:** 34-byte coefficient table
- **Program Params:** 96-byte workout configuration
- **Echo Control:** 32-byte Echo mode parameters
- **Color Scheme:** 34-byte LED color configuration

All protocol frames are byte-perfect matches to the original web application.

## Development Roadmap
